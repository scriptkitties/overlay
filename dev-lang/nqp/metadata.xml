		This is "Not Quite Perl" -- a lightweight Perl 6-like environment for
		virtual machines. The key feature of NQP is that it's designed to be a
		very small environment (as compared with, say, perl6 or Rakudo) and is
		focused on being a high-level way to create compilers and libraries for
		virtual machines like MoarVM [1], the JVM, and others.

		Unlike a full-fledged implementation of Perl 6, NQP strives to have as
		small a runtime footprint as it can, while still providing a Perl 6
		object model and regular expression engine for the virtual machine.
